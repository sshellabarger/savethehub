# ARKANSAS REGIONAL INNOVATION HUB COOPERATIVE
## **COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP FINANCING PLAN - COOPERATIVE MODEL**

**Prepared for:** Community Advisory Committee  
**Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Legal Structure:** Member-owned Cooperative (501(c)(3) with cooperative features)  
**Property:** 201 E. Broadway, North Little Rock, AR

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This plan outlines a financially sustainable, member-owned cooperative model for the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub. The cooperative structure:

✅ **Core operations funded by EARNED INCOME** - memberships, classes, fabrication services  
✅ **Grant programs tracked SEPARATELY** with dedicated staff (Skills to Launch, etc.)  
✅ **Volunteer workforce** reduces staffing costs, members earn discounts  
✅ **Cooperative ownership** - voting and non-voting members control the Hub  
✅ **Federal compliance** maintained through 2035 EDA grant requirement  
✅ **True community ownership** - members own and govern the space

---

## **SECTION 1: COOPERATIVE STRUCTURE**

### **WHY A COOPERATIVE MODEL?**

**Traditional Nonprofit Problems:**
- Board disconnected from users
- Decisions made "for" community, not "by" community
- Passive membership vs. active ownership
- Limited accountability to actual users

**Cooperative Solution:**
- **Members = Owners** - those who use the Hub control it
- **Democratic governance** - one member, one vote (voting members)
- **Distributed leadership** - committees run programming
- **Economic participation** - members invest labor and capital
- **Community accountability** - owned by those who use it

### **LEGAL STRUCTURE: 501(c)(3) COOPERATIVE**

**Entity Type:** Nonprofit corporation with cooperative bylaws  
**Tax Status:** 501(c)(3) tax-exempt  
**Governance:** Member-elected board of directors  
**Ownership:** No individual equity, members have voting rights

**This structure allows:**
- ✅ Tax-deductible donations
- ✅ Grant eligibility (foundation, government, corporate)
- ✅ Property tax exemptions
- ✅ Member democratic control
- ✅ Volunteer labor structure

## **SECTION 10: WHY COOPERATIVE STRUCTURE WORKS**

### **COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL NONPROFIT:**

| **Factor** | **Traditional Nonprofit** | **Cooperative** |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Ownership** | Board (disconnected) | Members (users) |
| **Governance** | Top-down | Democratic |
| **Sustainability** | Grant-dependent | Earned income focused |
| **Engagement** | Passive users | Active owners |
| **Labor** | All paid staff | Hybrid paid + volunteer |
| **Mission Drift** | Common (follows grants) | Rare (member-controlled) |
| **Accountability** | To board/funders | To member-owners |
| **Long-term Viability** | Depends on grants | Built on member commitment |

### **COOPERATIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE HUB:**

1. **Financial Sustainability**
   - 64% of core budget from earned income (member dues, services)
   - Not dependent on any single grant
   - Members have skin in the game

2. **Democratic Control**
   - Voting members elect board
   - Major decisions require member approval
   - Community truly owns the space

3. **Volunteer Workforce**
   - Members contribute labor for reduced dues
   - Builds ownership and community
   - Sustainable staffing model

4. **Mission Protection**
   - Members ensure mission continuity
   - Can't be sold or redirected by board alone
   - Federal compliance guaranteed by member-owners

5. **Equity and Access**
   - Tiered membership (sliding scale possible)
   - Student discounts
   - Volunteer credit system

## **SECTION 12: RISK ANALYSIS**

### **RISK #1: INSUFFICIENT MEMBERSHIP REVENUE**

**Risk:** Can't reach 440 members in Year 1

**Probability:** Low-Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (revenue shortfall)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Founding member campaign** - Pre-sell 100 memberships before opening
2. **Tiered pricing** - Ensure affordable access ($12 student to $50 individual)
3. **Volunteer credits** - Members can work for $0 dues
4. **Corporate partnerships** - Bundle memberships with business sponsorships
5. **Library transition** - Reach out to Library's 71K users served

---

### **RISK #2: VOLUNTEER PROGRAM DOESN'T SCALE**

**Risk:** Can't recruit/retain 50+ volunteers

**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium (higher staffing costs)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Built into membership** - Voting membership requires volunteer hours
2. **Financial incentive** - Earn credit toward dues
3. **Skills development** - Volunteers learn front desk, admin, teaching
4. **Social reward** - Recognition, community, ownership feeling
5. **Backup plan** - Can hire additional PT front desk if needed ($40K)

---

### **RISK #3: FABRICATION REVENUE UNDERPERFORMS**

**Risk:** Can't reach $70K in services revenue

**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Low-Medium ($70K is 11% of core budget)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Business development** - Dedicated outreach to startups, small businesses
2. **Portfolio building** - Showcase projects to attract clients
3. **Competitive pricing** - Undercut commercial shops initially
4. **Partnership model** - Work with incubators, accelerators for referrals
5. **Flex strategy** - If low Year 1, increase class revenue to compensate

---

### **RISK #4: GRANT PROGRAMS DON'T MATERIALIZE**

**Risk:** Can't secure $275K in grants

**Probability:** Low (Skills to Launch, Best Buy already exist)  
**Impact:** Low (grants are additive, not essential)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Core ops sustainable without grants** - This is the key design feature
2. **Multiple grant sources** - Not dependent on any single funder
3. **Proven track record** - Hub served 71K people 2014-2025
4. **Strong relationships** - Existing connections with funders
5. **Scale back** - If grants are less, hire fewer grant-funded staff (core unaffected)

## **SECTION 13: COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES**

### **COOP vs WINROCK SALE vs TRADITIONAL NONPROFIT**

| **Factor** | **Winrock Sale** | **Traditional Nonprofit** | **COOPERATIVE** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Community Control** | None | Board (limited) | Members (full) |
| **Financial Model** | N/A | Grant-dependent | Earned income + grants |
| **Federal Compliance** | Uncertain | Maintained | Guaranteed |
| **Ownership** | Private buyer | Board holds | Members own |
| **Sustainability** | N/A | Grant risk | Member commitment |
| **Volunteer Labor** | N/A | Limited | Core feature |
| **Democratic Voice** | None | Minimal | One member, one vote |
| **Mission Drift Risk** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Equity/Access** | Lost | Varies | Built-in (sliding scale) |
| **Timeline** | Uncertain | 3-4 months | 3-4 months |

---

## **SECTION 14: CONCLUSION**

### **THIS PLAN IS VIABLE BECAUSE:**

1. **Core operations funded by EARNED INCOME (87%)** - not grant-dependent
2. **Cooperative structure** - member-owners ensure sustainability
3. **Volunteer workforce** - reduces costs, builds community
4. **Grant programs separate** - additive, not essential
5. **Proven demand** - 71,000 people served 2014-2025
6. **Federal compliance** - member-owned ensures mission through 2035
7. **Democratic control** - community truly owns what it built

### **FINANCIAL SUMMARY:**

```
Year 1 Revenue..................................... $1,078,400
Year 1 Expenses.................................... $  902,335
Year 1 Net Income.................................. $  176,065

Core Ops Earned Income............................. $  563,400  (87% of core)
Total Earned Income................................ $  563,400  (52% of total)
Grant Dependency................................... LOW (core sustainable without)

Members............................................ 455+ (Year 1)
Volunteers......................................... 50-75 active
Staff (Core)....................................... 6 FTE
Staff (Grant-funded)............................... 3-4 FTE
```

### **THE COOPERATIVE DIFFERENCE:**

Traditional nonprofits serve their communities.  
**Cooperatives ARE their communities.**

The Hub was built with:
- $1 million federal taxpayer dollars
- North Little Rock city support  
- Business and foundation grants
- Thousands of volunteer hours
- Community vision and labor

**Winrock acquired it for $1.**

**The community should own what the community built.**

**And in a cooperative, the community DOES own it.**

## **WHY COOPERATIVE OWNERSHIP MATTERS**

The Innovation Hub was never meant to be owned by a nonprofit from D.C.  
It was built BY the community, FOR the community.

A cooperative structure ensures:
- ✅ **Members who USE the space CONTROL the space**
- ✅ **Democratic governance - one member, one vote**
- ✅ **Financial sustainability through earned income**
- ✅ **Volunteer labor builds ownership and community**
- ✅ **Federal compliance guaranteed by member-owners**
- ✅ **True community ownership - not just rhetoric**

**The Hub belongs to Arkansas. Let's bring it home to its rightful owners: the makers, learners, entrepreneurs, and dreamers who built it.**

**Together, we own the means of creation.**
