# ARKANSAS REGIONAL INNOVATION HUB COOPERATIVE
## **COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP FINANCING PLAN - COOPERATIVE MODEL**

**Prepared for:** Community Advisory Committee  
**Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Legal Structure:** Member-owned Cooperative (501(c)(3) with cooperative features)  
**Property:** 201 E. Broadway, North Little Rock, AR

  

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This plan outlines a financially sustainable, member-owned cooperative model for the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub. The cooperative structure:

  **Core operations funded by EARNED INCOME** - memberships, classes, fabrication services  
  **Grant programs tracked SEPARATELY** with dedicated staff (Skills to Launch, etc.)  
  **Volunteer workforce** reduces staffing costs, members earn discounts  
  **Cooperative ownership** - voting and non-voting members control the Hub  
  **Federal compliance** maintained through 2035 EDA grant requirement  
  **True community ownership** - members own and govern the space

  

## **SECTION 1: COOPERATIVE STRUCTURE**

### **WHY A COOPERATIVE MODEL?**

**Traditional Nonprofit Problems:**
- Board disconnected from users
- Decisions made "for" community, not "by" community
- Passive membership vs. active ownership
- Limited accountability to actual users

**Cooperative Solution:**
- **Members = Owners** - those who use the Hub control it
- **Democratic governance** - one member, one vote (voting members)
- **Distributed leadership** - committees run programming
- **Economic participation** - members invest labor and capital
- **Community accountability** - owned by those who use it

### **LEGAL STRUCTURE: 501(c)(3) COOPERATIVE**

**Entity Type:** Nonprofit corporation with cooperative bylaws  
**Tax Status:** 501(c)(3) tax-exempt  
**Governance:** Member-elected board of directors  
**Ownership:** No individual equity, members have voting rights

**This structure allows:**
-   Tax-deductible donations

## **SECTION 2: FINANCIAL MODEL**

### **PHILOSOPHY: CORE OPS FUNDED BY EARNED INCOME**

**Critical Principle:**
- **Core operations MUST be sustainable from earned income + baseline support**
- Grants pay for THEIR OWN dedicated staff and programs
- Grant programs are ADDITIVE, not essential to survival
- If grants disappear, core Hub continues operating

### **BUDGET STRUCTURE:**

| Component | Details | Funding Source |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **CORE OPERATIONS BUDGET** | | |
| Core Staff (7 FTE) | | Memberships, Classes, Fabrication, Baseline Support |
| Facilities & Operations | | Memberships, Classes, Fabrication, Baseline Support |
| Debt Service (Property) | | Memberships, Classes, Fabrication, Baseline Support |
| **GRANT-FUNDED PROGRAMS (Separate)** | | |
| Skills to Launch | Dedicated staff + expenses | Grant-funded |
| Best Buy Teen Tech Center | Dedicated staff + expenses | Grant-funded |
| Microsoft TechSpark | Dedicated staff + expenses | Grant-funded |

**Note:** Each grant tracked separately, contribution to overhead

  

## **SECTION 3: CORE OPERATIONS BUDGET**

### **ANNUAL CORE BUDGET: $637,935**

#### **PERSONNEL (6 FTE): $397,043**

**These are NON-GRANT staff funded by earned income:**

| Position | Annual Salary | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Executive Director | $84,500 | Leadership, fundraising, operations, facilities |
| Maker Educators (5 FTE) | $247,000 | Equipment training, instruction, member support, program coordination, safety compliance |
| Member Services & Outreach (1 FTE) | $40,000 | Reception, membership, communications, admin, community outreach, marketing *Supplemented by member volunteers* |
| Payroll Taxes & Workers Comp | $34,943 | |
| **TOTAL CORE PERSONNEL** | **$406,443** | |

**NOTE:** Grant-funded staff (Skills to Launch instructors, Teen Tech coordinators, etc.) are **NOT included** in this budget. They are hired and paid from their specific grants.

**MAKER EDUCATOR COMPENSATION MODEL:**

| Component | Rate/Details |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Base Salary** | $35,000/year (0.7 FTE equivalent) |
| **Class Revenue Share** | 30% of net class revenue they teach |
| **Fabrication Revenue Share** | 20% of net fabrication revenue they manage |
| **Expected Total Compensation** | $49,400/year average per educator |

**Why This Model Works:**

1. **Incentivizes excellence** - More students = more income
2. **Entrepreneurial flexibility** - Educators develop their specialties
3. **Risk sharing** - Base salary guarantees stability
4. **Revenue generation** - Educators directly drive income
5. **Professional growth** - Build personal brand and expertise

**Example Educator Earnings:**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base Salary | $35,000 |
| Class Revenue (teaches 40 classes @ avg $500 net = $20K) | $6,000 |
| Fabrication Revenue (manages $40K in projects @ 20%) | $8,000 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COMPENSATION** | **$49,000** |

If an educator is exceptional and drives more classes/projects, they earn more. If slow periods occur, base salary provides security.

## **SECTION 9: COMPLIANCE & FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **EDA COMPLIANCE (2014 GRANT - EXPIRES 2035)**

**Original Federal Investment:** $1,000,000 (Economic Development Administration)

**Use Restriction:** Property must remain in use for economic development and community benefit through **2035** (21-year useful life requirement).

**Compliance Requirements:**

| Requirement | Cooperative Approach |
|------------|---------------------|
| Community economic development use | ✓ Entrepreneurship training, fabrication services, job skills |
| Public access | ✓ Open to all community members (sliding scale pricing) |
| Job creation/retention | ✓ Skills to Launch program, business incubation |
| Serve low-income populations | ✓ Volunteer credits, student rates, scholarships |
| Annual reporting | ✓ Executive Director submits compliance reports |
| Non-profit ownership | ✓ 501(c)(3) cooperative structure |

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Winrock sale to private buyer:** High risk of compliance violation (change in use)
- **Cooperative ownership:** Zero risk of compliance violation (mission-aligned)

  

### **501(c)(3) COMPLIANCE**

**IRS Requirements for Tax-Exempt Status:**

| Requirement | How Cooperative Meets It |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Charitable purpose | Education, community development, poverty alleviation |
| Community benefit | Open membership, sliding scale, scholarships |
| No private inurement | No individual equity ownership, member-controlled |
| Primarily charitable activities | Classes, training, community programs |
| Public support test | Diverse revenue (membership, classes, donations, grants) |

**Advantage:** Cooperative structure enhances 501(c)(3) compliance (broad community ownership vs. self-perpetuating board).

## **SECTION 12: RISK ANALYSIS**

### **RISK #1: INSUFFICIENT MEMBERSHIP REVENUE**

**Risk:** Can't reach 440 members in Year 1

**Probability:** Low-Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (revenue shortfall)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Founding member campaign** - Pre-sell 100 memberships before opening
2. **Tiered pricing** - Ensure affordable access ($12 student to $50 individual)
3. **Volunteer credits** - Members can work for $0 dues
4. **Corporate partnerships** - Bundle memberships with business sponsorships

  

### **RISK #2: VOLUNTEER PROGRAM DOESN'T SCALE**

**Risk:** Can't recruit/retain 50+ volunteers

**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium (higher staffing costs)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Built into membership** - Voting membership requires volunteer hours
2. **Financial incentive** - Earn credit toward dues
3. **Skills development** - Volunteers learn front desk, admin, teaching
4. **Social reward** - Recognition, community, ownership feeling
5. **Backup plan** - Can hire additional PT front desk if needed ($40K)

  

### **RISK #3: FABRICATION REVENUE UNDERPERFORMS**

**Risk:** Can't reach $70K in services revenue

**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Low-Medium ($70K is 11% of core budget)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Business development** - Dedicated outreach to startups, small businesses
2. **Portfolio building** - Showcase projects to attract clients
3. **Competitive pricing** - Undercut commercial shops initially
4. **Partnership model** - Work with incubators, accelerators for referrals
5. **Flex strategy** - If low Year 1, increase class revenue to compensate

  

### **RISK #4: GRANT PROGRAMS DON'T MATERIALIZE**

**Risk:** Can't secure $235K in grants

**Probability:** Low (Skills to Launch, Best Buy already exist)  
**Impact:** Low (grants are additive, not essential)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Core ops sustainable without grants** - This is the key design feature
2. **Multiple grant sources** - Not dependent on any single funder
3. **Proven track record** - Hub served 71K people 2014-2025
4. **Strong relationships** - Existing connections with funders
5. **Scale back** - If grants are less, hire fewer grant-funded staff (core unaffected)

  

## **SECTION 13: COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES**

### **COOP vs WINROCK SALE vs TRADITIONAL NONPROFIT**

| **Factor** | **Winrock Sale** | **Traditional Nonprofit** | **COOPERATIVE** |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Community Control** | None | Board (limited) | Members (full) |
| **Financial Model** | N/A | Grant-dependent | Earned income + grants |
| **Federal Compliance** | Uncertain | Maintained | Guaranteed |
| **Ownership** | Private buyer | Board holds | Members own |
| **Sustainability** | N/A | Grant risk | Member commitment |
| **Volunteer Labor** | N/A | Limited | Core feature |
| **Democratic Voice** | None | Minimal | One member, one vote |
| **Mission Drift Risk** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Equity/Access** | Lost | Varies | Built-in (sliding scale) |
| **Timeline** | Uncertain | 3-4 months | 3-4 months |

  

## **SECTION 14: CONCLUSION**

### **THIS PLAN IS VIABLE BECAUSE:**

1. **Core operations funded by EARNED INCOME (81%)** - exceeds operating costs with minimal baseline support
2. **Cooperative structure** - member-owners ensure sustainability
3. **Volunteer workforce** - reduces costs, builds community
4. **Grant programs separate** - additive, not essential
5. **Proven demand** - 71,000 people served 2014-2025
6. **Federal compliance** - member-owned ensures mission through 2035
7. **Democratic control** - community truly owns what it built

### **FINANCIAL SUMMARY:**

### **THE COOPERATIVE DIFFERENCE:**

Traditional nonprofits serve their communities.  
**Cooperatives ARE their communities.**

The Hub was built with:
- $1 million federal taxpayer dollars
- North Little Rock city support  
- Business and foundation grants
- Thousands of volunteer hours
- Community vision and labor

**Winrock acquired it for $1.**

**The community should own what the community built.**

**And in a cooperative, the community DOES own it.**

## **WHY COOPERATIVE OWNERSHIP MATTERS**

The Innovation Hub was never meant to be owned by a nonprofit from D.C.  
It was built BY the community, FOR the community.

A cooperative structure ensures:
-   **Members who USE the space CONTROL the space**
-   **Democratic governance - one member, one vote**
-   **Financial sustainability through earned income**
-   **Volunteer labor builds ownership and community**
-   **Federal compliance guaranteed by member-owners**
-   **True community ownership - not just rhetoric**

**The Hub belongs to Arkansas. Let's bring it home to its rightful owners: the makers, learners, entrepreneurs, and dreamers who built it.**

**Together, we own the means of creation.**
