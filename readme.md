# Arkansas Innovation Hub Cooperative
## Project Overview

### Mission & Vision

The Arkansas Innovation Hub Cooperative aims to restore and sustain the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub as a community-owned makerspace, educational facility, and economic development resource for North Little Rock and the broader Arkansas region.

**Mission**: Provide accessible tools, training, and community workspace that empowers Arkansas entrepreneurs, makers, artists, and students to develop skills, launch businesses, and contribute to regional economic development.

**Vision**: A thriving, financially sustainable makerspace owned and governed by its community members, serving as a cornerstone of downtown Argenta's revival and a STEAM education hub for Arkansas students.

### Problem Statement

The Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub, built in 2015 with $3.5 million in federal EDA funding, was closed by the North Little Rock Public Library System due to financial unsustainability. The closure eliminated critical maker education and entrepreneurship support services in a region with limited alternatives. The facility remains underutilized despite its significant federal investment and strategic location in the revitalizing Argenta Arts District.

### Solution: Community Cooperative Model

The cooperative model addresses the sustainability challenges that led to the Library's closure:

**Earned Income Focus**: Membership fees, educational programming, fabrication services, and space rental generate operating revenue rather than depending on unpredictable grant funding.

**Community Ownership**: Members have ownership stakes and governance participation, creating stronger investment and engagement than traditional nonprofit models.

**Reduced Operating Costs**: Lean staffing with revenue-sharing educator compensation models reduces overhead while maintaining service quality.

**Federal Compliance**: The cooperative structure maintains EDA economic development requirements while enabling long-term community stewardship.

### Key Objectives

1. **Acquire Property**: Negotiate purchase from Winrock International or secure long-term lease that satisfies remaining 10-year federal EDA obligation
2. **Achieve Financial Sustainability**: Generate $419,006 in annual earned income to cover core operations
3. **Restore Community Services**: Reopen maker facilities including fabrication labs, classrooms, and collaborative workspace
4. **Serve Arkansas Students**: Deliver STEAM education programming for K-12 students, homeschool families, and school district field trips
5. **Support Economic Development**: Provide resources for entrepreneurs, artists, and small businesses aligned with EDA mission
