# Arkansas Innovation Hub Cooperative
## Foundation & Corporate Partnerships

### Fundraising Philosophy

The Hub's fundraising strategy positions foundation and corporate support as **startup capital and capacity building investment**, not operational subsidy. The earned income model demonstrates long-term sustainability, making the Hub an attractive investment for mission-aligned funders seeking community impact with financial viability.

### Case for Support Messaging

#### Core Narratives

**Preservation of Federal Investment**:
"The Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub represents a $3.5 million federal Economic Development Administration investment in North Little Rock's economic future. The cooperative model ensures this critical community asset serves its intended purpose for generations to come."

**Community Ownership Creates Sustainability**:
"Unlike traditional nonprofit models dependent on unpredictable grants, the cooperative structure creates member ownership and earned income sustainability. Your investment enables launch, but the community ensures long-term success."

**Economic Development Impact**:
"Makerspaces generate measurable economic impact: entrepreneur business launches, prototype-to-production pathways, workforce skill development, and downtown revitalization. The Hub serves as infrastructure for Arkansas' innovation economy."

**Educational Excellence**:
"Arkansas students deserve access to hands-on STEAM education that prepares them for advanced manufacturing, engineering, and technology careers. The Hub provides resources few schools can afford, democratizing access to tools and training."

**Equity and Access**:
"The cooperative model ensures affordable access regardless of income. Student memberships at $25/month, scholarship programs, and school partnerships remove barriers that exclude low-income families from maker education."
