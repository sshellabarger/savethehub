## Community Campaign to Preserve the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub

## 📋 Campaign Overview

The Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub was built in 2015 with $1 million in federal taxpayer funds (EDA Grant #08-01-04368) to serve as Arkansas's premier makerspace and STEAM education facility. After serving 71,000+ people across 20 Arkansas counties from 2014-2025, the Hub faces closure as Winrock International plans to sell the property.

**Our Mission:** Acquire the Hub for community ownership through a member-owned cooperative structure, ensuring continued service through the federal grant's 2035 requirement while building a financially sustainable, democratically-controlled community asset.
